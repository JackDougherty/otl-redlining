  <p>During the 1930s Depression, Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) federal agency worked with local banks to assign mortgage lending risk ratings to neighborhoods, from the best (A, colored green) to the worst (D, colored red). HOLC measured not only physical conditions, but also the "social status of the population," and downgraded neighborhoods with Black, immigrant, and lower-income residents. In later decades, activists labeled these discriminatory lending practices as "redlining."
