  <h2>Map: Federal HOLC "Redlining" in Hartford CT, 1937</h2>

  <p>Click on color-coded areas to view ratings by the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC), which recommended neighborhoods to receive mortgage lending from the highest level (A, in green) to the lowest (D, in red). This federal agency worked with local banks and lenders to evaluate Hartford and over 200 other cities during the Great Depression. They measured not only physical conditions, but also the "social status of the population," and downgraded neighborhoods with non-white, immigrant, and poor residents. In later decades, activists labeled these discriminatory lending practices as "redlining." See the original maps (Hartford-West Hartford and East Hartford), the full appraisal report (PDF), and searchable spreadsheet (CSV), to come.
