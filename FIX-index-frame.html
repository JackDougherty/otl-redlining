  <h2>Map: Race Restrictive Covenants in Hartford area, 1940s</h2>
  <iframe src="index.html" width="100%" height="550"></iframe>
  <p>Click on colored rectangles to view racial restrictions, typically against residents “other than the Caucasian race,” that some housing developers wrote into property deeds in the Hartford region during the early 1940s. The U.S. Supreme Court validated the right of private property owners to insert these restrictions when it declined to hear the 1926 Corrigan v. Buckley case, but later ruled in the 1948 Shelley v Kraemer case that such covenants were no longer enforceable by governmental authority. Yet these restrictive clauses still exist in today's legal records. To date, we have found racial covenants for a handful of housing developments in West Hartford.
